		<link>http://dexperix.net</link>
		<description>This site is a DeXPeriX's Home page. This site is not actually "page", but much more. You can find near 1000 pages at this site.

The aim of this site is to be maximally unique and interesting. You can find billions of sites, that dublicates content of each other. I think, they are useless. Thats why you can find only unique content at this site.
